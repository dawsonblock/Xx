# Credits

AnyJev stands on other people's work. Attribution lives here, not in identifiers.

## Projects we run, adapt to, or compare against

- **TypeSafe AI, Jev** — the product that defined the interface (state, typed questions, calibrated answers in one pass). Not affiliated; their published numbers appear in our tables clearly marked as published, never as measured by us.
- **Laya** (NandhaKishorM/laya, Apache-2.0) — open trained decision models; we run their three checkpoints through their own `predict` API on LocalLLaMA/typed-decisions (`bench/providers/laya.py`).
- **NanoJev** (TianyuCodings/NanoJev, MIT) — nano replica with games; we run their frozen maze exploration code and their own untuned-Qwen baseline script (`bench/providers/nanojev_maze.py`, `bench/providers/nanojev_native_maze.py`) and their released episode data.
- **LocalLLaMA/typed-decisions** (Apache-2.0) — the 400-case, 2,000-decision workflow set with teacher soft labels.
- The open readout clones that documented the problem first: SemIf, LitJev, the OpenJev servers, poorjev, open-llm-classifier. Their READMEs said the probabilities were not calibrated and the order mattered; this repo measures it.

## Reported and contributed

People outside the project whose reports and patches changed the code. Issue numbers are in the
CHANGELOG next to what they fixed.

- **[@efronh](https://github.com/efronh)** — found that L2 was broken on transformers 5 and
  identified the renamed `create_causal_mask` argument in the report (#4).
- **[@lws2004](https://github.com/lws2004)** — found that the `hf` extra could not build a backend
  at all, traced it to `device_map` and the undeclared `accelerate`, and supplied the change that
  fixes that, the Apple Silicon segfault and the `.model` assumption together (#5).
